## What Might
- if the screenshot only the login page that means that the login credentials weren't correct
- Right now it's only waiting 5 seconds for the account to load to take the screenshot , in case of a slow internet It might take longer than that u will have to try again and try to eliminate any thing using internet to reduce the load time
